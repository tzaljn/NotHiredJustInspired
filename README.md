Our goal: to prepare individuals for a reality check in the job market

How it works:
Users input a dream job and get a rejection letter from their dream company.
Other than the fact that it is a silly rejection, the intention behind it is 
to encourage users to simply take the mounted rejections as a motivation, thus 
inspiring them to continue moving forward in the market race.
