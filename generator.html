                We have great news! After reviewing your application for ${dreamJob},
                we can confidently say that… you are absolutely incredible.<br><br>
                
                Now for the not-so-great news: We have decided to move forward with another candidate. 
                Not because you weren’t the perfect choice, but because our HR team ran out of coffee 
                and started making questionable decisions.<br><br>

                We considered offering you the job anyway, but then we realized… we don’t deserve you. 
                You deserve an office with a built-in espresso machine, a chair that actually supports 
                your spine, and a salary that doesn’t make you question your life choices. Sadly, we 
                cannot provide that at this time.<br><br>

                But don’t be discouraged! We believe in you, and we’re 99% sure your dream job is just 
                around the corner (maybe at a place with better hiring judgment). Until then, keep being 
                amazing, and if you ever want to apply again, please do—preferably when Mercury isn’t in 
                retrograde.<br><br>
                
                Keep striving for excellence and never stop dreaming! <br><br>
                Best wishes, <br>
                Your Dream Company
